# multiping
Threaded command-line ping for multiple simultaneous destinations

Built for bash/linux environments, this script leverages the PING3 library and threading to "simultaneously" generate pings to multiple destinations and display data about reachability and response time.  Ping timeout and number of pings are configurable.
